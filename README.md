| ---- | ------------ | ----------- |
| char | 1 byte | -128 to 127 |
| unsigned char | 1 byte | 0 to 255 |
| short | 2 byte | -32,768 to 32,767 |
| unsigned short | 2 byte | 0 to 65,535 |
| int | 4 byte | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| unsigned int | 4 byte | 0 to 4,294,967,295 |

| unsigned long | 8 byte | 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,61 |

### Binary operators

Bitwise operations

+ `|` OR
+ `&` AND
+ `<<` LEFT SHIFT
+ `>>` RIGHT SHIFT
+ `^` XOR
+ `~` NOT

Expression operator 

```c
a = 402; /* 00000001 10010010, 402 */
b = 98;  /* 00000000 01100010, 98 */
a | b;   /* 00000001 11110010, 498 */
a & b;   /* 00000000 00000010, 2 */
a >> 2;  /* 00000000 01100100, 100 */
a << 2;  /* 00000110 01001000, 1608 */
~a;      /* 11111110 01101101, 4294966893 */
```
